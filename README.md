#  Data Analysis with Python by freeCodeCamp 

In this repository, I apply my knowledges on different projects, made by freeCodeCamp, 
Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Scipy librairies Python in order to process, visualize and make predictions.

You can find out what each one is about if you access them individually, 

* ### Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator 
Function that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.

* ### Demographic Data Analyzer 
Analysis of demographic data using Pandas. The dataset contains demographic data extracted from the 1994 Census database.

* ### Medical Data Visualizer 
Visualization and calculations from medical examination data using matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas. The dataset values were collected during medical examinations.

* ### Page View Time Series Visualizer 
Visualization of time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots (made with Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn). The dataset contains the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03.

* ### Sea Level Predictor 
Analysis of a dataset containing the global average sea level change since 1880, using the Scipy library to predict the sea level change through year 2050.
